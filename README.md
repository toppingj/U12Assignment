# U12Assignment
Unit 12 Assignment for Programming Python Course


This program was developed to fit the purpose for my Unit 12 Assignment for Programming in Python.
This program asked to establish different arrays, list their data type, grab info from the arrays and their axes and print that as well.
The assignment then specified to use .plot() to create a chart, then create a horizontal bar graph, and then a scatter plot.
